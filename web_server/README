To compile this source code just open a terminal, navigate to the './web_server' directory and type the following commands: 
- "make" (to compile the executable file); 
- "make clean" (to remove created objects files).

NOTE: "imagemagick" package required.

Now, assuming you always be in './web_server' directory, to run the software just type: "./web_server" or "./web_server -h" for information on the possible options to use.
